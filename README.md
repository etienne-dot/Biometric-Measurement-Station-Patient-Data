## Disclaimer: 
This system is intended for testing purposes only and is not suitable for real-world use. It lacks security by design and should not be used for sensitive or critical applications.

## Issues:
1. Heart Rate Reading Inaccuracy
The heart rate reading provided by the system isn't accurate.

2. Hard-Coded Passwords
There are hard-coded passwords inside files (such as database connection scripts), which can present a security risk.

### Note: These issues are not being addressed as they fall outside the current project scope.
